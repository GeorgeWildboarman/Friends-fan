# Build ChatBot to talk with 'Friends'


## Introduction 


Hello!!!


I just started learning Python by myself, so I'm still a beginner.


Now I'm trying to build a chatbot with Python3 to have a fun. 
It will help to improve my skills, although it will take me a very long time to complete.


Give it a try!


My goal is to make a simple chatbot that talks as if it were one of 'Friends'. 
Because I am a fan of 'Friends', popular American television sitcom.


All the resources of the scripts of 'Friends' are provided by Crazy For Friends.

## 1. Crawl and Scrape


Get the contents of the scripts and store them in a local folder by each of the episodes.


## 2. Learning NLTK(Natural Language Toolkit) for Natural Language Processing(NLP)



## Conclusion


Bye,bye!
