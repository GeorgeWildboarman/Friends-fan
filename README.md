# Build ChatBot to talk with 'Friends'


## Introduction 


Hello!!!


I just started learning Python by myself, so I'm still a beginner.


Now I'm trying to build a chatbot with Python3 to have a fun. 
It will help to improve my skills, although it will take me a very long time to complete.


Give it a try!


My goal is to make a simple chatbot that talks as if it were one of 'Friends'. 
Because I am a fan of 'Friends', popular American television sitcom.


All the resources of the scripts of 'Friends' are provided by Crazy For Friends.

Resource website URL: http://www.livesinabox.com/friends/scripts.shtml


## 1. Crawl and Scrape

[grab-webcontents.py](grab-webcontents.py)
- Get the contents of the scripts from [the resource site](http://www.livesinabox.com/friends/scripts.shtml). 
- Store them in a local directory assigned by an argument.
 

Usage: python3 grab-webcontents.py [dir_path=.scripts] 
dir_path is direcory path and default is '.scripts'.


```bash
python3 grab-webcontents.py .scripts
```
